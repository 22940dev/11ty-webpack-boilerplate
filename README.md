__This webpack boilerplate is for beginner, intermediate, and advanced developers looking to get started _immediately_ creating static websites while acheiving all the right optimizations to score perfect on [Google Page Speed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/) and [Google Lighthouse Reports](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/)__ — This is an evolution of [tris-gulp-boilerplate](https://github.com/tr1s/tris-gulp-boilerplate), now with Webpack 4!!!! Webpack 4 is the new standard for bundling JS which [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) wasn't capable of. Thankfully Webpack can run tasks and build js 💪.

__Version 1 status has been acheived.__ More thorough documentation will come soon.

### Usage:

You need [git](https://git-scm.com/) and [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) on your computer before running.

1. `git clone https://github.com/tr1s/tris-webpack-boilerplate.git`
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run start`

You're all set, start coding 👩‍💻👨‍💻 !

Remove everything in the `src/styles/` folder, `src/index.html` and `src/index.scss/` if you'd like to start 100% fresh and/or create your own Sass worklow. I based my folder structure off the [7-1 pattern](https://vanseodesign.com/css/sass-directory-structures/).
