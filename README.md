# tris-webpack-boilerplate

__This webpack boilerplate is for beginner, intermediate, and advanced developers looking to get started _immediately_ creating static websites__ â€” This is an evolution of [tris-gulp-boilerplate](https://github.com/tr1s/tris-gulp-boilerplate), now with Webpack 4.0!!! Webpack 4 is the new standard when for bundling JS to help get your website rank higher by covering all optimizations (bundling, minifying, optimizing)!

## Status

This current v.07 is working, but is missing some optimizations. I'll update the docs when I reach V1 status. ðŸ’Œ
