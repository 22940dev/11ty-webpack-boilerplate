# tris-webpack-boilerplate

__A webpack boilerplate for static websites__ â€” This is an evolution of my [tris-gulp-boilerplate](https://github.com/tr1s/tris-gulp-boilerplate), now with Webpack 4.0!!!

## Status

This current v.07 is working, but is missing some optimizations. I'll update the docs when I reach V1 status. ðŸ’Œ
